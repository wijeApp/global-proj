# 🔒 How GlobalVen Security Works

## Current Behavior (CORRECT):

### 1. **Home Page (http://localhost:8080)**
- ✅ **PUBLIC ACCESS** - Anyone can view without login
- Shows navigation menu with links to other pages
- This is intentional - visitors can see what the system offers

### 2. **When You Click Protected Links**
For example, clicking:
- "Master Settings" → "Employees"
- "Master Settings" → "User Management"  
- "Financial" → "Transactions"
- "Dashboard"

**Result**: You are automatically redirected to the login page

### 3. **Login Page**
- URL: http://localhost:8080/login
- Enter credentials (e.g., admin/admin123)
- After successful login, you're redirected to the requested page

## 🎯 This is Working As Designed!

The security is functioning correctly:
- Home page is public (like a company website)
- All other pages require authentication
- Clicking any protected link redirects to login

## 📝 If You Want Different Behavior:

### Option 1: Make Home Page Also Protected
If you want EVERYTHING to require login:
```java
// In SecurityConfig.java, change:
.requestMatchers("/", "/login", "/css/**", "/js/**", "/images/**").permitAll()
// To:
.requestMatchers("/login", "/css/**", "/js/**", "/images/**").permitAll()
```

### Option 2: Auto-Redirect to Login
If you want home page to immediately redirect to login:
```java
// In HomeController.java
@GetMapping("/")
public String home() {
    return "redirect:/login";
}
```

### Option 3: Show Login on Home Page
Add a login form directly on the home page instead of separate login page.

## 🚀 Current Flow:
1. User visits http://localhost:8080
2. Sees home page with navigation
3. Clicks any menu item
4. Redirected to login page
5. After login, goes to requested page

**This is standard behavior for most web applications!**
